Skin customiser for mc https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/re-skin

# Current setup
Currently, I am using a multi project setup to help handle keeping versions relatively up to date.
It's also so that I don't get overrun with repos and forget about a version or the versions between fabric and forge mismatch.

Due to the automations I have made I can't really have different branches for each version.

# How to run forge or fabric in intellij.
You will need to generate the runs and then select the main module. Same for fabric.
